                <ul>
                    <li>Accurate, descriptive titles?</li>
                    <li>Relevant and useful product description?</li>
                    <li>High-quality images?</li>

                    <li>Clear and concise bullet points?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember that shoppers who click on your ad will be taken to your product detail page, and a strong product detail page can help convert the click into a sale. Watch this <a href="#">short video</a> for examples.</p>
                <h3>HERE’S HOW:</h3>
                <p>High-quality listings help improve the customer experience by making it easier for customers to find, evaluate and purchase your products. Automatically detected enhancement opportunities are shown in your Seller Central account under Inventory > Manage Inventory > Listing Enhancements. </p>

                <h2>Winning the Buy Box</h2>
                <p>Your product must be in stock and priced competitively in order to win the Buy Box, so take into account product pricing and availability. We recommend ensuring your campaigns are always on so that you can capitalise on times when you win the buy box.</p>
                <b>Remember that if your products are not winning the Buy Box or are out of stock, your ad will not display.</b>
                
                <h3>HERE’S HOW:</h3>
                <p>You can view buy box percentage data for your SKUs under the Reports tab in Seller Central; click on Business Reports, and under the section labelled By ASIN, click on Detail Page Sales and Traffic by Child Item.</p>

                <h2>Remember some basics about Sponsored Products ads</h2>
                <p>Sponsored Products ads are a great way to promote individual listings to shoppers as they’re searching and browsing items to buy; keep in mind a few basics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ads are targeted to keywords.</li>

                    <li>Ads may appear top and bottom side within search results and on product detail pages, across desktop and mobile.</li>

                    <li>You pay only when your ad is clicked.</li>

                    <li>The advertiser will never be charged more than their bid. For Sponsored Products, the only adjustment to the bid is if the advertiser selects to use Bid+ and the ads are eligible to appear on Top of Search. In these cases, we will increase the bid by up to 50% to compete for impressions at Top of Search.</li>

                    <li>Depending on the quality of your ad and your competitors, you pay an amount close to the second highest bidder. If there are no competitors for a keyword in an auction, you will be charged the minimum price of the auction, which varies depending on the auction and where we show the ad.</li>

                    <li>You can control how much you spend by an easy stop/pause option and your ACoS can be easily monitored in an accessible dashboard or through downloadable reports.</li>

                    <li>After a shopper clicks on the ad, Amazon will attribute any order that shopper places for that product and any of the seller’s other products within a conversion window. In campaign manager interface, we only show 1-week attribution for same SKU and other SKU sales aggregated. SP attributed sales exclude cancelled orders and payment failures.</li>
